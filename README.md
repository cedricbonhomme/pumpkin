[Pumpkin](https://github.com/scandale-project/pumpkin),
is a libre software which is providing
a __backend architecture__ for collecting data from probes and storing proof
of checks.

The platform is providing:

- a documenteted HTTP API connected to an aggregation engine;
- connection with a database (PostgreSQL);
- the aggregation engine also provides a PubSub mechanism;
- a backend to deploy and monitor a network of probes with the
  [Smart Python Agent Development Environment](https://github.com/javipalanca/spade);
- ``Ad hoc module``: a module in order to share data with external platforms,
  such as MISP or other database systems.


## Presentation

A[Probe with periodic behaviour] -->|JSON formatted result| B(Aggregation)

```

The aim of this rather complex example is to show what is currently possible
to do. You can install an aggregation engine with only one probe
on the same server. But probes can be deployed on a large scale and use a
behavioral mechanism to accomplish their duty.

A probe can reason locally or globally.
The selection of the communication channel between probes is automatic,
based on the probes duties, behaviour and availability. A probe do not
need to know the IP server of an other component of the architecture
(database, aggregation engine, etc.).

Each probe agent is authenticated, registered and declare its availability
(for the presence notification system). The OMEMO protocol can be used for
communications between agents.
