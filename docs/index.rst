SCANDALE
========

Presentation
------------

`SCANDALE <https://github.com/scandale-project/scandale>`_, is a libre software which is providing a backend architecture
for collecting data from probes and storing proof of checks (cryptographic timestamping).

The platform is composed of:

- a documented HTTP API with a PubSub mechansim and a connection to a
  database;
- a backend to deploy and monitor a network of probes.
  The architecture is relying on the
  `Smart Python Agent Development Environment <https://github.com/javipalanca/spade>`_;
- a service to timestamp the collected data with a third party
  (`RFC 3161 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3161.txt>`_) for the proof of checks.

It is possible to extend the platform in order to share data with external
system, such as MISP.
