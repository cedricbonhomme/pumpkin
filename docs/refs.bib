abstract = {The paper provides a global architectural and decision support solution for a reaction after alert detection mechanisms in the frame of information systems security applied to telecom infrastructures. Therefore, the architecture is developed in a distributed perspective and is composed of three basic layers: the low level that constitutes the interface between the architecture and the infrastructure. The intermediate level that is responsible of correlating the alerts coming from different domains of the infrastructure and to deploy the reaction actions. The architecture is elaborated using a MAS associated to the OntoBayes model for decision mechanism. This model helps agents to make decisions according to preference values and is built upon ontology based knowledge sharing, Bayesian networks based uncertainty management and influence diagram. The major novelty of this Decision Support System is the layered view of the infrastructure thanks to MAS architecture, which enables the decision making with different levels of knowledge.},

abstract = {Power distribution constitutes a critical service for our economy. To foreseen electricity overload and risks of power blackout according to external perturbations such as the weather, the temperature or the barometric pressure in real time is a crucial challenge. In order to face those problems, research tends to involve consumers in the utilization of the electricity based on weather conditions. Our previous works had proposed an agent based architecture to support this alert mechanism. The architecture exploited a static assignment of functions to agents. That static assignment was a weak point because isolating an agent or breaking the communication channel between two of them created serious damage on the crisis management. In this paper, we complete our previous works and make dynamic the assignment of functions mobile for agents. Our approach exploits the concept of agent responsibility that we dynamically assigned to the agent taking into consideration the agent's reputation.},

    abstract = {The IT community is confronted with incidents of all kinds and nature, new threats appear on a daily basis. Fighting these security incidents individually is almost impossible. Sharing information about threats among the community has become a key element in incident response to stay on top of the attackers. Reliable information resources, providing credible information, are therefore essential to the IT community, or even at broader scale, to intelligence communities or fraud detection groups. This paper presents the Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) and threat sharing project, a trusted platform, that allows the collection and sharing of important indicators of compromise (IoC) of targeted attacks, but also threat information like vulnerabilities or financial indicators used in fraud cases. The aim of MISP is to help in setting up preventive actions and counter-measures used against targeted attacks. Enable detection via collaborative-knowledge-sharing about existing malware and other threats.},
